The Nintendo 3DS is a handheld gaming console that was released in 2011. It has two screens, one of which is a touch screen, and a 3D feature that can be adjusted or turned off. The Nintendo 3DS also has a built-in camera that can take 3D photos and videos[^2^]. The console has a variety of games, some of which have original soundtracks that use the system's sound chip.
 
Some music producers have extracted the sound samples from these games and created soundfonts that can be used in digital audio workstations (DAWs) such as FL Studio. These soundfonts can help recreate the sound of the Nintendo 3DS games, or create new music with a retro or nostalgic feel. Some examples of Nintendo 3DS soundfonts are:
 
- Soccer Shootout Soundfont: This is a soundfont from the New Nintendo 3DS game called Soccer Shootout. There are only 3 instruments used: a whistle, a kick, and a crowd[^1^].
- Pokemon X/Y Soundfont: This is a soundfont from the Pokemon X and Y games, which were released in 2013. The soundfont contains over 200 instruments, such as pianos, guitars, drums, strings, brass, woodwinds, and more.
- Animal Crossing: New Leaf Soundfont: This is a soundfont from the Animal Crossing: New Leaf game, which was released in 2012. The soundfont contains over 100 instruments, such as bells, marimbas, accordions, harpsichords, and more.

To use these soundfonts in your music projects, you need to download them from the internet and load them into your DAW. You can then assign them to different tracks or channels and play them with a MIDI keyboard or sequencer. You can also adjust the volume, pitch, pan, reverb, and other effects to suit your preferences.
 
Nintendo 3DS soundfonts are a great way to add some variety and creativity to your music production. They can help you achieve a unique sound that is reminiscent of the Nintendo 3DS games, or inspire you to make something new and original. If you are interested in using Nintendo 3DS soundfonts in your music projects, you can find them online on websites such as Musical Artifacts[^1^] or Zanderjaz[^3^]. Happy music making!
